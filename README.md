# 📝 Sentiment Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project performs **sentiment analysis** on text data using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** for feature extraction and various **machine learning models**. The goal is to classify text into **positive or negative sentiment** with high accuracy.

## 🚀 Features
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** (n-grams, sublinear TF, stopword removal)
- **Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes** for classification
- **Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV**
- **Performance evaluation using accuracy and classification reports**

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes
- **Feature Engineering**: TF-IDF
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
